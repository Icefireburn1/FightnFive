# General Info
This is a small project that aims to create a simple and complete role-playing game experience. The game consists of 3 chapters, each of which has 5 floors/battles to participate in. Commanding 4 characters, the character must defeat each enemy on every floor. The enemies get progressively harder, but the character will get stronger as well. After every battle, the player is able to upgrade their units to make them stronger.

# Technologies
- [Unity](https://unity.com/) - C# game engine that handles game rendering and input. Through the use of C# scripts, developers are able to utilize the Unity framework to create a game without having to worry about the low-level development of the GUI.

# Build

git clone https://github.com/Icefireburn1/FightnFive.git
```
