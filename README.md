# General Info
This is a small project that aims to create a simple and complete role-playing game experience. The game consists of 3 chapters, each of which has 5 floors/battles to participate in. Commanding 4 characters, the player must defeat each enemy on every floor. The enemies get progressively harder, but the characters will get stronger as well. After every battle, the player is able to upgrade their units to make them stronger.
